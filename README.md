## Overview

Hi, I'm Eren and I study at Eskisehir Technical University as a Computer Science 2. grade student. I made a realtime chat app called SprinkaiChat with MERN Stack. I made this site to improve my coding skills. I used MongoDB technologies and MongoDB Atlas. To use my app just create an acount, log in, join a room and chat with other people!
